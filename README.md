## Features

- Smooth, continuous spinning animation
- Automatically transitioning ASCII color palette
- Keyboard input to control spin speed in real time
- Lightweight: no graphics engine, pure Python math
- Motion trail effects for a sleek, glowing aesthetic
- Compatible with macOS Terminal & most modern terminals

---

## Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### `requirements.txt`

```text
colorama
pynput
```

---

## How to Run

```bash
python donut.py
```

- Press ↑ to speed up rotation
- Press ↓ to slow down rotation
- Real-time speed display shown at bottom
- Exit anytime with `Ctrl+C`

## Create a GIF from Terminal

To capture a `.gif` animation from your terminal:

```bash
python record_donut.py
```

This will save a `donut.gif` using `pyautogui` and `imageio`. Ensure terminal is in focus during recording.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by [a1k0n's legendary donut math demo](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html), originally written in C. It’s reimagined here in Python, with interactivity, animated colors, and terminal-ready enhancements.

## Future Ideas

- Add mouse interaction (e.g. drag to rotate, click to pause)
- Toggle animation modes: wireframe, filled, shadows
- Support ASCII shading themes (classic, neon, retro)
- Publish as a pip package (`pip install ascii-donut`)
- Turn into a desktop widget using tkinter or Electron
